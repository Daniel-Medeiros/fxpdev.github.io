Today is a special day for Sony Xperia lovers. The founder of the FreeXperia Project, <a title="" href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2014/06/02/alin-jerpelea-from-cyanogenmods-freexperia-team-joins-sonys-developer-program/" target="_blank">Alin Jerpelea, has been welcomed</a> into Sony's developer program!

Sony Mobile has been extremely supportive of community developers. The Sony team has always provided great support for developers interested in their devices. Regular open source code updates, easy access to Sony APIs, several independent AOSP releases, and even custom code and blobs for ROMs like CyanogenMod.

Strengthening the connections with Alin, a well respected member of the custom ROM community, will allow him to focus on the things he has loved doing for years; playing with Xperia devices.

So what can we expect in the future?

Today, nothing changes. We will continue to work on the devices we have. We will continue our weekly releases of CyanogenMod.

However, as was hinted at during <a title="" href="https://plus.google.com/113803222429716837173/posts/j4Uf9Nmz4hq" target="_blank">Sony's presentation at Droidcon Berlin</a>, <em>great</em> things are coming...

We <strong>all</strong> wish Alin the best of luck working with the Sony Mobile team!
