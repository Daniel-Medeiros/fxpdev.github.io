Sony Mobile has released a lot of devices under the Z series of devices. Phones, tablets, phablets and compacts. All of them have two things in common: fantastic design and water resistance.

The Sony Xperia Z3 family was revealed at IFA2014, and includes three devices; Sony Xperia Z3, Sony Xperia Z3 Compact and Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Tablet.

Despide virtually identical specs to the Xperia Z1 and Z2 devices, the Xperia Z3 devices distinguish themselves with a refreshed design, and improved water resistance.

The new design includes rounded edges, shock absorbant corners to protect the device when dropped, and a new range of colours with the highlight being the copper variant.

The copper variant succeeds at providing a 'premium' colour for those who like their bling, yet it manages to stay classy, unlike the gaudy faux-gold that other manufacturers impose on their customers.

There was nary a mention of internal specs during the presentation, the highlight features were all software based, such as extra camera effects, HD audio support, and PlayStation 4 streaming.

This lack of specs can be seen throughout all the major IFA presentations; the next generation of 64-bit processors is simply not ready yet for flagship devices.

Therefore we now have three generations of Z devices with little to differenciate them except design. The maximum frequency does increase slightly with each generation, but the reality is that smartphones are designed to spend as little time at the top frequencies as possible.

However, that copper looks <em>realy</em> shiny...
