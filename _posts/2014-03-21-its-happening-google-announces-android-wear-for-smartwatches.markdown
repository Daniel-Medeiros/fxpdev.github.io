Sony Mobile's SmartWatch, Samsung's Gear, Pebble's err.. Pebble and many more are already trying to get a head start in the upcoming smartwatch wars. Yet all of the entries so far have had relatively limited interest and success due to the proprietary nature of each platform.

Google has today introduced a new platform and SDK, Android Wear, that aims to provide a set of standards that all manufacturers can implement in smartwatches and other wearable devices.

As is typical of new Google services these days, the primary interface bears a strong resemblance to its 'Google Now' service which provides the right information at the right time. It also has a strong emphasis on using voice commands to control the device.

Together with the SDK, Google and Motorola have announced the Moto 360, a truly watch-like smart device that even rivals the excellent design of Sony Mobile's SmartWatch 2.

The video above shows how naturally useful Google expects these devices to be. Anyone who has used Google Now on a smartphone can easily recognise the scenarios depicted, with most shots displaying similar information on the Moto 360's round screen.

In fact it's not hard to imagine a similar device from Sony Mobile with the waterproof omni-balance design and the now iconic silver power button.

We would love to see a Sony Mobile device that integrates Google's Android Wear platform, would you?
