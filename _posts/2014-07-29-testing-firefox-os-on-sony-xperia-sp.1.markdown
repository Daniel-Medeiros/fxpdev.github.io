Not many people know it, but Mozilla is building an operating system for mobile devices. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/" title="" target="_blank">Firefox OS</a> is an open source alternative to Android, which rejects the traditional idea of packaged apps in favour of 'web apps'.

The concept is simple: any website can be an app. Google+, Twitter, Facebook and many more already provide mobile specific websites, and Firefox OS takes advantage of that. When you 'install' an app you are actually adding a bookmark to that website.

It's of course a bit more complicated than just creating a list of bookmarks. Installed apps can take advantage of hardware features, provide notifications, and other things you typically expect from apps.

To make development quicker and easier, Firefox OS relies heavily of the foundations of Android. Mozilla has removed the Dalvik virtual machine and replaced it with their own Gecko rendering engine. This means that at a low level there is very little difference between a Firefox OS phone and an Android phone.

So what is good for Mozilla is good for other developers too! Potentially <em>any</em> Android phone can become a Firefox OS phone. In fact Sony Mobile has already shown interest in the project. As early as February 2013, an experimental build was provided for <a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2013/02/27/experimental-firefox-os-software-for-xperia-e-available-for-developers-rom/" title="" target="_blank">Sony Xperia E</a> and in March 2014 Sony Mobile submitted <a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2014/03/07/sony-submits-gadget-functionality-to-firefox-os-for-evaluation-video/" title="" target="_blank">'gadget' functionality</a> to Mozilla.

So out of curiosity, we decided to try Firefox OS for ourselves on a familiar device, <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/sony-xperia-sp/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia SP</a>.

Of course, working with a whole different operating system has its challenges. There are plenty of bugs and some of the hardware features do not work, but so far we like what we see. Firefox OS performs extremely well, we almost never saw the OS stutter or lag in the time we used it.

Bluetooth, GPS and the camera currently do not work, and there is a bug that prevents Firefox OS from recognizing the SIM card. However calls and sending SMS <em>does</em> work fine, WiFi works as expected, and all of the lights and sensors work too.

Despite these (temporary) limitations, the performance often feels better than using Android! In fact browsing to our favourite websites was often a better experience than using Chrome on Android... 

Firefox OS could be a great alternative to Android on low end hardware, and potentially revive old, forgotten hardware too.
