After going through half of the alphabet, Sony Mobile has chosen some letters that it really likes. The just announced <a href="/press-release/sony-introduces-xperia-z2-at-mwc2014/">Sony Xperia Z2</a> is the third generation of 'Z', The budget phones are on the second generation of 'E', and 'T' was brought back for a phablet device.

Now Sony Mobile is bringing a second generation of 'M' with the <a href="http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/xperia-m2-best-smartphone-tech-in-its-class/" target="_blank">Sony Xperia M2</a>. This device looks set to conqueror the mid-range that is currently served by Sony Xperia M and Sony Xperia L, two very similar phones.

The design looks very familiar as Sony Mobile now seems to be using its OmniBalance design across its whole range of devices. The last devices announced with different designs were <a href="/viskan-platform/sony-xperia-sp/">Sony Xperia SP</a> and Sony Xperia L.

However compared to its predecessor, the Xperia M2 is a significant upgrade. The screen size grows almost an inch, from 4.0 inches to 4.8 inches, the resolution gets bumped to 960x540 (not seen since <a href="/montblanc-platform/sony-xperia-p/">Sony Xperia P</a>), and the camera gets upgraded to 8MPx.

The SoC is Qualcomm MSM8926 which doubles the cores to 4 and bumps the speed by 20% to 1.2GHz. It's part of the same family as the SoC with Cortex-A7 CPU cores found in <a href="/press-release/sony-introduces-xperia-e1-and-xperia-t2-ultra/">Sony Xperia E1 and Sony Xperia T2</a>, both recently announced at CES2014.

We've yet to see how these cheaper cores compare to the Krait cores, but having more of them will definitely be an improvement.
