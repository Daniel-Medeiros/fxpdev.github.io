Sony Mobile has <a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2014/10/16/xperia-z2-and-other-new-devices-added-to-aosp-for-xperia-on-github-video-open-source/" target="_blank">announced the availability</a> of open source code for several Xperia devices.

One of the reasons FXP's Alin Jerpelea was hired by Sony Mobile was to improve the quality and availability of open source software for Xperia devices. Today the results of this effort are starting to show.

Alin has successfully encouraged several community developers to join his effort to create a single, unified kernel for all 'Z' devices, which is now hosted at <a href="https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/kernel" target="_blank">Sony Mobile's GitHub</a> page.

The aim is to have a central location for good quality <em>source code</em> for Xperia devices that can be used by any developer or project.

We have opened discussions at xda-developers.com for <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-z/orig-development/xperia-aosp-project-t2907466" target="_blank">Xperia Z</a>, <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-z1/orig-development/xperia-aosp-project-t2907468" target="_blank">Xperia Z1</a>, and <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-z2/orig-development/xperia-aosp-project-t2907471" target="_blank">Xperia Z2</a>Â if you have any questions regarding the source code.

Unfortunately Sony Mobile cannot officially publish uncertified ROMs, so it is down to the developer community to make good use of this source code.
<h4>Freedom, Xperience, Power</h4>
FXP is part of the developer community, so today we are announcing the availability of AOSP ROMs though this site for three devices: Xperia Z, Xperia Z1 and Xperia Z2.

This release is based solely on the source code as found on Sony Mobile's GitHub, so the same limitations that are mentioned in Sony's announcement apply here.

You can download it from the <a href="/aosp/aosp-4-4/">AOSP 4.4</a> page.

We strongly encourage any developer interested in Sony devices to help us by contributing back to the unified kernel and to the device repos. Together, we can make the perfect custom ROM experience.

Please remember, this release is <em>outside</em> of Alin's regular duties at Sony Mobile, and is a continuation of his work as part of the developer community. This release remains strictly independent, just like our current releases of CyanogenMod.
