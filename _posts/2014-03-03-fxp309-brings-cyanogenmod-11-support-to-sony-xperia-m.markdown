The FreeXperia Project is happy to announce the first new supported device for 2014, <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/sony-xperia-m/">Sony Xperia M</a>!

First revealed in June 2013, Sony Xperia M is one of Sony Mobile's devices designed for the lower mid-range market. It sits at the bottom of the <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/">Qualcomm Krait 200 Family (2nd Gen)</a> and features Qualcomm MSM8x27 SoC. This has dual-core Krait 200 CPUs at 1.0GHz and Adreno 305 GPU, with that you also get 1GB Ram, 4GB storage, a 4.0 inch 854x480 screen, and a 5MPx camera.

Support will start at FXP309 with <a href="/cyanogenmod/cyanogenmod-11/">CyanogenMod 11</a>.

The codename for Xperia M is <strong>Nicki</strong>, so make sure you download the correct ROM!

Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/RonGokhale/" target="_blank">Ron Gokhale</a> who did most of the work for this device. Since this is his first contribution to FreeXperia Project we asked him a couple of questions:

<strong>FXP: Why did you choose a device from Sony Mobile?</strong>
<em>Ron: Sony was the only OEM at that time making a device with MSM8x27 chipset. I wanted a good mid-range phone with Qualcomm chipset for daily use, Xperia M best matched my requirements.</em>

<strong>FXP: What difficulties did you have while working on CyanogenMod?</strong>
<em>Ron: Frankly speaking no difficulties. All my other devices that I worked on were legacy but no major problems to bring CyanogenMod to Xperia M.</em>
