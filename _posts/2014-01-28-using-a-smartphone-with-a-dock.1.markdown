Not content with capturing the most mobile attention at CES, Sony has announced another pair of devices just one week later. This time we see two budget-friendly devices which are sure to far outsell the Z1 Compact based on their target markets.

The Sony Xperia E1 is a compact phone which finally brings back the Walkman theme to hardware, last seen in the Sony Ericsson days. Its highlight features include a massive 100Db speaker for music playback and a dedicated Walkman button.

Meanwhile, the Xperia T2 Ultra is a 6 inch monstrosity designed for media consumption. It is targeted at 'emerging markets' which includes China, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific rim, so we may not get to see it in Europe.

These two devices also introduce our first new development platforms for 2014. Xperia E1 comes with MSM8210 while Xperia T2 Ultra is based on MSM8928, both are brand new Qualcomm SoC.

Both chips are based on Cortex-A7 CPUs, but differ in the number of cores and the GPU. MSM8210 is set to be Qualcomm's new ultra low cost SoC, it features a dual-core processor running at 1.2 GHz and an Adreno 302 GPU. the MSM8928 doubles the cores, bumps the clock speed to 1.4 GHz and also improves the GPU to Adreno 305. Both will also have dual-SIM variants.

In fact there's a whole range of SoC which combines dual and quad core Cortex-A7 processors with Adreno 302 and 305 GPUs in every combination imaginable. There's not much information available yet for these chips, however I suspect the only differences between them will be GPU clock speeds.
