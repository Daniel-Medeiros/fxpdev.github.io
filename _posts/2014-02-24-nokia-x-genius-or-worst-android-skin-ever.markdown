Sometimes Sony Mobile's competitors make announcements too big to ignore, as is the case today with Nokia, who used to OWN the mobile phone market.

Smartphones arrived without warning in June 2007 and Nokia suddenly found itself between a rock and a hard place. Since the frenzy of the iPhone and then the dominance of Android, Nokia's alternatives haven't had much success.

Nokia fans have long dreamed of an Android phone to come from Espoo, but when <del>Microsoft trojan</del> Nokia CEO Stephen Elop announced in February 2011 that the company was going exclusively with Windows Phone, many were bitterly disappointed.

Since then, Nokia's Lumia devices have failed to gain significant interest, simply because Windows Phone has failed to gain significant interest.

So when Microsoft suddenly revealed its intent to purchase Nokia's mobile division in September 2013, many believed it was to prevent its only major customer from defecting to Android. That fear may actually have had some merit, as today Nokia has announced <em>three</em> Android devices.

This is not your typical Android, However.

As you can see in the video above, Nokia has <strong>heavily</strong> customised their fork of AOSP to closely match the look and feel of the Asha range of phones. It has also dropped Google's services in favour of it own solutions, such as Skype, HERE Maps, and Nokia's own app store.

This also means that any apps that take advantage of Google's services will need to be rewritten before they can be used on these devices. In fact, most of what people see as the 'Android advantage' will not be valid for these devices.

The hardware is also pretty unspectacular. Nokia's use of Qualcomm's MSM8225 SoC means the device will be forever limited to Android 4.1 since Qualcomm dropped support for higher versions of Android.

Anyone who tries to port CyanogenMod will be limited to version 10.0, which is already no longer under development by the core CyanogenMod team, nor us at FreeXperia Project.

What's also interesting is that Nokia isn't afraid to admit this is using Android, The devices are being advertised as <em>"Your Fastlane to Android apps"</em>. This is in stark contrast to Samsung, who barely even acknowledges the fact.

However the target market is clear. These devices will primarily be sold in India and developing countries, as announced and as can be seen by the Indian names and faces in the video above. They will be cheap, and they will be sold by the truckload.

Perhaps this is just a temporary experiment, or perhaps this is the start of something big. What ever it is, the Nokia team has some courage to push this ahead knowing Microsoft is heavily breathing down their necks.

But that, of course, is the beauty of AOSP!
