For a long time now we have made weekly builds of three versions of CyanogenMod. Due to a lack of development, we have decided that Cyanogenmod 10.1 will no longer be built.

This is not a bad thing. CyanogenMod 10.1 is not supported by CyanogenMod nor is it under active development; only a handful of bugfixes have been merged since January 2014. All devices supported by FXP that have CyanogenMod 10.1 builds are also supported in CyanogenMod 10.2.

Anyone running CyanogenMod 10.1 can upgrade to CyanogenMod 10.2 (which is supported by CyanogenMod but also receiving only bug fixes) or CyanogenMod 11.0 for a significant upgrade in performace and features provided.
