Glass. Metal. Waterproof. It's all in the details.

If you've never had a waterproof phone, you may never notice just how much you protect your electronic devices from the slightest drop of water. Therefore the first time you test out a Sony Xperia Z series device in the sink, shower or swimming pool can be quite unnerving.

Just in time for summer fun, FXP is happy to announce support for <a title="" href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z2/">Sony Xperia Z2</a> and <a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z2-tablet/" title="">Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet</a>!

<a title="" href="http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/xperia-z2-best-camera-camcorder-in-waterproof-smartphone/" target="_blank">Revealed at WMC2014</a> in February, the Sony Xperia Z2 devices take the waterproof omnibalance design to a new level of perfection.

At first glance they appears very similar to previous Sony Xperia Z devices, but like the marketing campaing suggests, it's all in the details. The newer devices are thinner, the processors are faster, the batteries last longer, audio quality is improved, display quality is improved, camera quality is improved.

Sony Xperia Z2 becomes the new king of the <a title="" href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/" target="">Qualcomm Krait 400 family</a> and features a Qualcom MSM8974pro SoC. This has quad-core Krait 400 CPUs at 2.3GHz and Adreno 330 GPU, with that you also get 3GB RAM, 16GB storage, a 5.2 inch 1080p screen, and a 20MPx camera.

Likewise, Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet features the same Qualcom MSM8974pro SoC, but comes with a 10.1 inch 1920x1200px screen, and a 8.1MPx camera.

Support will start at FXP325 with CyanogenMod 11, however consider them 'alpha' builds as we work to add support for all of Sony's premium hardware enhancements which are not currently found in AOSP or CyanogenMod.

The codename for Sony Xperia Z2 is <strong>Sirius</strong>, for Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet LTE it is <strong>Castor</strong>, and for Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet Wifi it is <strong>Castor_windy</strong> so make sure you download the correct ROM!

<em>(This week the release will be delayed until tomorrow, but as usual, each device is uploaded when it is complete, so if you don't see your device immediately, check back later!)</em>
