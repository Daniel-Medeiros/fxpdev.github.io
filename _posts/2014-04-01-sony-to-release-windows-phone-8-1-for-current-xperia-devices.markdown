<strong>A</strong>n exciting announcement comes this week, as Sony Mobile has finally revealed the intention to bring Windows Phone 8.1 to the existing range of Xperia devices.

<strong>P</strong>eople may recall the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/rumor_microsoft_to_pay_other_companies_to_make_wp8_phones-news-7570.php" target="_blank">rumours from earlier this year</a> that Microsoft is to pay Sony Mobile up to $500 million to build a Windows Phone device. Part of that deal includes making Windows Phone 8.1 available for their existing handsets.

<strong>R</strong>espectively, if device owners wish to do so they will soon be able to erase their current version of Android 4.3 or 4.4 and replace it with Windows Phone 8.1 via Sony Mobile's PC Companion software. The process will reportedly take up to one hour, but this includes backing up and restoring al photos, music, and videos on the internal SD Card, as the device needs to be completely reformatted to comply with Windows Phone 8.1 partitioning.

<strong>I</strong>nitially not all devices will be supported however. Only those that have at least a 1080p screen will be included in the first wave of supported devices. This includes Xperia Z2, Xperia Z1, Xperia Z Ultra, Xperia Z, and Zperia ZL.

<strong>L</strong>ikewise there are unfortunately some exceptions. Xperia Z1S, the T-Mobile US exclusive, will not receive Windows Phone 8.1 due to contractual issues with the operator.

<strong>F</strong>ollowing that, a second wave that relaxes the resolution restriction to include all other devices with at least a 720p screen and OpenGL ES 3.0 compatible GPU may come in the future, depending on the success of this initial first wave.

<strong>O</strong>penGL ES 3.0 hardware is supposedly a requirement for Windows Phone 8.1, which rules out previous flagship devices such as Xperia T and Xperia V.

<strong>O</strong>verall, this means that Xperia Z1 Compact, Xperia ZR, Xperia SP and even Xperia T2 Ultra could also support Windows Phone 8.1, bringing the total to 9 Sony Xperia devices that may be running Windows Phone 8.1 in the near future.

<strong>L</strong>ower resolution screens, as well as limited storage space are the reasons given to not support potentially compatible devices such as Xperia M2, Xperia E1, Xperia L, and Xperia M.

<strong>S</strong>ony Mobile is sure to have success with this initiative, and has provided an <a href="http://youtu.be/32UGD0fV45g?t=1m54s" target="_blank">early video preview</a> of the operating system in action on some Xperia devices. The FreeXperia Project team is eagerly looking forward to testing out this exciting new possibility.
