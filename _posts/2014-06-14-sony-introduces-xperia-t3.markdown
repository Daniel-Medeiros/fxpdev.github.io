A couple of weeks ago Sony announced the extended cooperation with FXP founder Alin Jerpelea. During this exciting time we almost missed the announcement of <a href="http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/stand-out-from-the-crowd-with-the-stylish-and-slim-xperia-t3-smartphone-from-sony/" title="" target="_blank">Sony Xperia T3</a>.

This device is a smaller version of <a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/sony-xperia-t2-ultra/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia T2 Ultra</a>. The hardware is almost identical, the only major differences are an 8MPx camera in place of a 13MPx camera, and a smaller 2300 mAh battery.

What's interesting is that this device is slightly thinner than <a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z2/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z2</a>, however it is not waterproof.

Just like Sony Xperia T2 Ultra, it has Qualcomm MSM8928 SoC inside, which features a quad-core processor running at 1.4 GHz and an Adreno 305 GPU.

This may also mean that the devices will share kernel sources, making development for these two devices easier.
