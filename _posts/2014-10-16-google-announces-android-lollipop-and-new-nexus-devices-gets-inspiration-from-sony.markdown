Android 5.0 is now officially called Lollipop!

Google has finally revealed the new name for the latest version of Android. Along with this announcement comes the release of new Nexus devices.

While we will wait until the release of the actual sourcecode to talk about Android 5.0, we can't help notice that Google was greatly inspired by Sony's promotional videos. Compare the videos for Nexus 6 and Sony Xperia E3 below.

Similar videos can be found for most Xperia devices.
