It's been a while since our last device but FXP is happy to announce support for <a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/sony-xperia-t2-ultra/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia T2 Ultra</a>!

Sony Xperia T2 Ultra was <a href="/press-release/sony-introduces-xperia-e1-and-xperia-t2-ultra/" title="" target="">announced at CES2014</a> in January, but it didn't become available until several months later.

It is the first member of the <a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/" title="" target="">Qualcomm Cortex-A7 family</a>. It features a 1.4GHz quad-core Qualcomm MSM8926 SoC and Adreno 305 GPU, 1GB RAM, 8GB storage, a 6 inch 720p screen and a 13MPx camera.

Support will start at FXP344 with <a href="/cyanogenmod/cyanogenmod-11/" title="" target="">CyanogenMod 11</a>, however consider them ‘alpha’ builds as we work to fix any bugs found during wider testing. All major features work and it could be considered ready for 'daily use' for those who like to live on the edge.

The only significant issue is that while the camera works, it crashes when saving an image. Video recording works fine.

There are now six devices in the Cortex-A7 family, so you can expect several more announcements in the coming weeks.
