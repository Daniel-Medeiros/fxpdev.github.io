The tick-tock of major smartphone announcements by Sony Mobile has a roughly six month cadence. It is roughly six months since the tick of <a href="/press-release/sony-introduces-xperia-z2-at-mwc2014/">MWC2014 Barcelona</a> and the announcement of <a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z2/">Sony Xperia Z2</a>, so it's time for another tock, and another new flagship device.

The teaser video above is full of buzzwords like "shiny" and "powerful", and has several references to the number 3 which hints at the three new devices shown in a silhouette at the end of the video. The end also briefly flashes "7MM", "Cu", and "H2O" before the date; 03 September 2014.

"7MM" likely refers to the depth of the new devices, "H2O" refers to Sony's typical waterproof feature, but what about "Cu"?

Cu is the symbol on the periodic table for copper. However this metal is not normally used for the body of a smartphone as it is soft and tarnishes easily. Perhaps then it simply refers to its distinctive colour, and we will see a copper coloured Sony Xperia Z3.

What about inside these devices?

The 64bit MSM8994 is not expected until next year, so we may see that in Sony's <em>next</em> tick in 2015. That means they could either stay with a variant of MSM8974 for the <em>third</em> flagship in a row, or use the APQ8084. 

The APQ8084 chip has the same Krait CPUs as MSM8974, but it features the newer Adreno 420 GPU, which would be great for a 'gaming' device. However Sony recently <a href="http://www.jp.playstation.com/info/support/sp_20140806_psm_android.html" target="_blank">shut down its PlayStation Mobile</a> service, this seems unlikely.

What about all the references to time?

The latest craze is wearable devices, specifically smartwatches. Could we also see the announcement of a new Sony SmartWatch?

The show starts at 16:00 CEST on 3rd September 2014 and you can watch it live on your favourite technology blog.
