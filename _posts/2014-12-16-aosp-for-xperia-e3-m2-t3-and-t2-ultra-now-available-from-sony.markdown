AOSP repos for Xperia Z, Z1, and Z2 have been available <a href="/releases/announcing-aosp-for-z-z1-z2-more-devices-coming-soon/" title="" target="">for some time</a>, and a demonstration of Lollipop on Xperia Z3 was published mere days after the sources for Android 5.0 was released.

However many of you will know that not every Xperia device has a 'Z' in its name.

With the help of several FXP members, Sony Mobile has expanded the number of devices in the <a href="https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/kernel" title="" target="_blank">unified kernel</a>. Now <em>forteen</em> devices can be built from a single kernel source, including several based on the Cortex-A7 platform.

KitKat repos for Xperia devices based on the Cortex-A7 platform are also now available.

The Cortex-A7 devices that can be built from this kernel:

<ul>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/sony-xperia-e3/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia E3</a></li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/sony-xperia-m2/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia M2</a></li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/sony-xperia-t3/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia T3</a></li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/sony-xperia-t2-ultra/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia T2 Ultra</a></li>
</ul>
The Krait-400 devices that can be built from this kernel:
<ul>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z-ultra/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z Ultra</a></li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z1/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z1</a></li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z1-compact/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z1 Compact</a></li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z2/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z2</a></li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z2-tablet/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet</a> (both LTE and WiFi variants)</li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z3/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z3</a></li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z3-compact/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z3 Compact</a></li>
	<li><a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z3-tablet-compact/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact</a> (both LTE and WiFi variants)</li>
</ul>

As was the case with the previous releases, Sony cannot officially publish uncertified ROMs so it is down to the developer community to make good use of this source code.

We strongly encourage any developer interested in Sony devices to help by contributing back to the unified kernel and to the device repos. Together, we can make the perfect custom ROM experience.

The complete set of repos can be found on <a href="https://github.com/sonyxperiadev?tab=repositories" title="" target="_blank">Sony Mobile's GitHub </a>page.
