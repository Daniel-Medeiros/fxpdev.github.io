It has been almost exactly one year since the release of Android 4.4 KitKat, and CyanogenMod 11 has been with us for nearly all of that time. It took only a couple of weeks to start nightlies for the first select devices.

Now that Android 5.0 is almost upon us, we have stopped builds of CyanogenMod 10.2 as we get ready for the craziness of porting the many Sony devices that we support to Lollipop.

This is not a bad thing. Only a handful of device specific patches were <a title="" href="http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/q/status:merged+branch:cm-10.2,n,z" target="_blank">merged into the cm-10.2 branch</a> in the past six months. In fact our Sony Xperia SP was one of the last devices to receive any significant attention on CyanogenMod 10.2.

From FXP343, only CyanogenMod 11 will be available.

CyanogenMod 11 will continue to be built for the foreseeable future, and we want to increase our AOSP efforts in the near future too. Of course we can only discuss CyangenMod 12 when the CyanogenMod team is ready to discuss it.
