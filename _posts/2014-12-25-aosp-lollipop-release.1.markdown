We recently wrote about <a href="/releases/aosp-for-xperia-e3-m2-t3-and-t2-ultra-now-available-from-sony/" title="" target="">AOSP repos available from Sony Mobile</a> for many Xperia devices.

Today, just in time for Christmas, we are starting AOSP Lollipop nightly builds.

All devices previously mentioned to get AOSP Lollipop support will receive nightly builds, with the exception of the WiFi variants of the two tablets, which will come later.

Android 5.0 Lollipop made ART the default runtime, which gives a noticeable performance boost on low end devices like <a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/sony-xperia-e3/" title="" target="">Xperia E3</a>. Performance is great, the only major device function that is not working is the camera.

There will be threads open at <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com" title="" target="_blank">xda-developers.com</a> for each device in the respective sections to discuss these ROMs.

As with our CyanogenMod builds they will be automatically uploaded from the build server to the links on the <a href="/aosp/aosp-5-0/" title="" target="">AOSP 5.0</a> page. If you cannot find your device just check back after a couple of hours.

Now that all devices are supported it is time to relax and enjoy a well earned holiday.

It's clear that Sony Mobile will continue to release new devices next year. FXP will of course continue this new tradition of working with Sony Mobile to support the newest devices in AOSP.

Sony Mobile is a pioneer in providing developer support and open source solutions for so many devices. We also hope that in the new year we will see more developers contributing fixes to the official device repos.

See you in 2015!
