For some, the beginning of May is a time to celebrate Spring, for others it's a time to work on CyanogenMod. The FreeXperia Project is happy to announce the third supported device for 2014, <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/sony-xperia-l/">Sony Xperia L</a>!

First revealed in March 2013, Sony Xperia L is the last device from 2013 to be (finally) supported by FreeXperia Project. It is one of Sony Mobile's devices designed for the lower mid-range market. It sits near the bottom of the <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/">Qualcomm Krait 200 Family (2nd Gen)</a> and features Qualcomm MSM8x30 SoC. This has dual-core Krait 200 CPUs at 1.0GHz and Adreno 305 GPU, with that you also get 1GB Ram, 8GB storage, a 4.3 inch 854x480 screen, and an 8MPx camera.

Support will start at FXP318 with <a href="/cyanogenmod/cyanogenmod-11/">CyanogenMod 11</a>, although we are calling it an 'alpha' release due to some minor issues we still have with storage. However it's currently being worked on so it will get fixed in an update in the near future!

The codename for Xperia L is <strong>Taoshan</strong>, so make sure you download the correct ROM!

Give a big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/varunchitre15" target="_blank">Varun Chitre</a> who did most of the work for this device, with a bit of help from FreeXperia veteran Alin Jerpelea. Since this is Varun's first contribution to FreeXperia Project we asked him a couple of questions:

---

<strong>FXP: Why did you choose a device from Sony Mobile?</strong>
<em>Varun: Actually my primary reasons to buy Xperia L was not to develop for the device, it's specifications one year ago were exactly what I needed.</em>

<strong>FXP: What difficulties did you have while working on CyanogenMod?</strong>
<em>Varun: For difficulties, the challenging job was to deal with internal storage, everything else was easy.</em>
