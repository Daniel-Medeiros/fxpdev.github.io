Earlier this week Sony Mobile teased a new flagship phone for 2014 with a 15 second teaser video and the <em>#XperiaDetails</em> hashtag. Now that we know more about the <a href="http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/xperia-z2-best-camera-camcorder-in-waterproof-smartphone/" target="_blank">Sony Xperia Z2</a>, it really is about the details when looking for the differences between it and the <a href="/rhine-platform/sony-xperia-z1/">Sony Xperia Z1</a>.

The design is almost indistinguishable from the Xperia Z1, which was itself almost indistinguishable from the Xperia Z. But that's a good thing, Sony Mobile's 'OmniBalance' and waterproof designs can be easily recognised among the sea of generic phone designs, and it is quickly filtering down to the lower end with the Sony Xperia E1.

The device is actually slightly smaller than the Xpeira Z1, but it manages to squeeze in a slightly larger 5.2-inch screen. This should help push the device higher up the <a href="https://twitter.com/somospostpc/status/433251245114286080" target="_blank">chart that measures the screen-to-bezel ratio</a>.Â The other big improvement is a bump of the RAM from 2GB to 3GB.

The rest of the differences are quickly lost in the details. The device will launch with Android 4.4 KitKat (yay!), the 'new' processor is 100MHz (4.5%) faster, it weighs 11 grams (6.5%) less, and the camera now supports 4K video recording. However since the camera appears to be the same, it's possible this could also be brought back to the Xperia Z1 too.

The Xperia Z2 is another great phone from Sony Mobile, but for Android developers it is actually a bit boring. The hardware hasn't changed much over the past year, so porting CyanogenMod should be relatively easy based on what we already know about the Xperia Z1. But that's another good thing; anything we learn about the Xperia Z2 will also benefit Xperia Z1, Xperia Z1 Compact and Xperia Z Ultra owners.
