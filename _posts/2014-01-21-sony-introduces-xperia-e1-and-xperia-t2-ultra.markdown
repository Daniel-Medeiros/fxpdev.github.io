excerpt: Not content with capturing the most mobile attention at CES, Sony has announced another pair of devices just one week later. This time we see two budget-friendly devices which are sure to far outsell the Z1 Compact...

Several great mobile accessories are available from Sony Mobile that really enhance Xperia devices, including <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/accessories/stereo-bluetooth-headset-sbh80/">bluetooth headphones</a>, <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/accessories/smarttags-nt3/">NFC SmartTags</a> and even an <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/accessories/dsc-qx100/">external camera lens</a>.

However only a few flagship devices are compatible with a dock, such as the recently announced <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/accessories/magnetic-charging-dock-dk32/">magnetic charging dock</a> for Sony Xperia Z1 Compact, as well as other waterproof Xperia devices. Despite not being much more than a glorified USB cable, these simple accessories really take the pain out of keeping your smartphone juiced up without fumbling with the waterproof panels over the micro USB ports.

The reason other devices don't get docks from Sony is simple: other Xperia devices come in different shapes and sizes, with the location of the micro USB port seemingly placed randomly. Every device would need its own dock, since Sony hasn't standardized on a specific location for the micro USB port.

Luckily for us, third-party accesory producers have stepped up to seize the gap in the market left by Sony. Deal Extreme is a site that sells a lot of very <del>cheap junk</del> cheap gadgets from China, and they shipped me a <a href="http://dx.com/p/desktop-charging-cradle-usb-to-micro-usb-cable-set-for-sony-xperia-sp-m35h-black-242820#.Ut78gzdwYoN">micro USB dock</a> designed for <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/sony-xperia-sp">Sony Xperia SP</a> for less than 8 Euros. 

While the quality is not comparable to the phone it is designed for, the dock does the job well. It's not as simple to use as the magnetic dock mentioned above, but the phone slides into place easily enough and stays firmly in place. It works with wall chargers and USB connections to the PC as expected, with the added benefit of being secure and easy to read.

Other than that there's not much else to say. It's a charging dock, and it works. If you own a Sony Xperia SP, give it a try!
