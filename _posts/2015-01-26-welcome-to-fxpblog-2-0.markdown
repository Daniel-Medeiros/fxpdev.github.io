Today you may have noticed something different around here.

FXP Blog has provided you with the latest and greatest Android versions for your Xperia devices for several years, yet this website has been running on software from the digital stone age. Gone is the PHP based WordPress site that needs a dedicated server to run on. We now have a new [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) home based on [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) technologies and hosted as a [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) organization page.

The great thing about using Jekyll is we can use markdown to write our articles and pages. This greatly speeds up the process as we don't need to fool around with html tags all day, and we can quickly get back to hacking on Android!

We have tried to keep the links the same as the old site so your bookmarks should still work the same. It wasn't possible for all pages, and not everything was moved to the new site so you may find some discrepancies here and there.

There may also be a few bugs here and there as we had to get this site written in just a few weeks due to a server problem on the old site (you may have noticed it looked a bit strange for a while).

However the beauty of [hosting on GitHub](https://github.com/fxpdev/fxpdev.github.io) is that *anyone* can send us a fix through the usuall GitHub pull request process. perhaps even _you_ can contribute to our site too...

We hope you like the new home!
