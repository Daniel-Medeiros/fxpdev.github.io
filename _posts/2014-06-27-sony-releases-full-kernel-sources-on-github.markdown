Only a few weeks after bringing our favourite community developer onto their team, Sony Mobile is already putting him to good use.

Today <a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2014/06/27/we-heard-you-sony-kernel-sources-now-available-on-github/" title="" target="_blank">Sony Mobile has announced</a> that they will be bringing their kernel sources online at <a href="https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/kernel-copyleft" title="" target="_blank">Github</a> for everyone to use.

This marks the start of a big change in how Sony will distribute open source code. So far, the source code has been distributed as a compressed archive with no source history. It was then up to developers to find similar kernel sources from CodeAurora Forums.

The compressed archives will continue to be produced, as these contain more than just the kernel. However this will make wokrking with the kernel much easier, as we now know which changes are from Sony.

For now, the plan is to support all devices since the release of <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/sony-xperia-z/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia Z</a>. The priority is for the flagship Z, Z1 and Z2 devices, and later the other devices.

This initially excludes devices such as <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-1st-gen/sony-xperia-t/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia T</a>, the flagship device before Sony Xperia Z. However since Android 4.3, this device shares kernel sources with <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/sony-xperia-sp/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia SP</a>, so the door is not yet fully closed on this device.

We are assured that this is just the beginning of a great wave of projects to support developers, so stay tuned to the Sony blogs for more exciting announcements!
