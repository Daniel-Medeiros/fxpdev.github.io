Since 2012, Sony Mobile has introduced a new flagship phone every six months or so, each time using the latest and greatest silicon that Qualcomm can offer at the time. It started with <a href="/fuji-platform/sony-xperia-s/">Sony Xperia S</a> in January 2012 at CES Las Vegas, followed by <a href="/blue-platform/sony-xperia-t/">Sony Xperia T</a> in September 2012 at IFA Berlin. The same two trade shows were used to introduce the <a href="/fusion3-platform/sony-xperia-z/">Sony Xperia Z</a> in January 2013, and most recently the <a href="/rhine-platform/sony-xperia-z1/">Sony Xperia Z1</a> in September 2013.

Mobile World Congress has had a slightly different focus in the past. In 2012 Sony Mobile introduced the '<a href="http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/sony-mobile-communications-introduces-xperia-p-and-xperia-u-smartphones-for-connected-entertainment-experiences/" target="_blank">NXT Series</a>', a whole range of devices to celebrate the rebranding from Sony Ericsson to Sony Mobile. in 2013 the highlight of the show was the Xperia Tablet Z and a focus on waterproof devices.

However this year’s CES was used to introduce the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact, not a new flagship device but a smaller variant of the Sony Xperia Z1 still based on the MSM8974 SoC. Therefore we are yet to see any devices based on Qualcomm’s latest and greatest in 2014, the <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/media/releases/2013/11/20/qualcomm-technologies-announces-next-generation-qualcomm-snapdragon-805" target="_blank">APQ8084 SoC</a> with 4th generation Adreno graphics and improved Krait 450 CPU cores.

A quick analysis of CodeAurora Forums tells us that this SoC will make use of a Linux 3.10 kernel which is still under heavy development. This is a significant change from the Linux 3.4 based kernels used by the majority of SoC in 2012 and 2013. There's a chance it simply might not be ready yet and we may see another device with a slightly faster MSM8974 SoC.

If we do see Sony Mobile’s next flagship phone at MWC, it’s likely that the design won’t differ much from the Z and Z1 style, some say it may even be called the Z2. But that’s not a bad thing, both of these devices are beautiful and extremely well made.

Mobile World Congress is still a couple of weeks away and there’s plenty of time for more product announcements. We would love to see a whole new range of devices for 2014, but whatever Sony Mobile's plans are, there’s always plenty to get excited about.
