Midrange smartphones of today are as powerful as the top end phones of the previous generation. Released in mid 2013, The <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/sony-xperia-sp/">Sony Xperia SP</a> is a close match to the <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-1st-gen/sony-xperia-t/">Sony Xperia T</a>, the James Bond themed flagship phone released in the latter half of 2012.

In fact in several ways it is more of a hybrid of the Sony Xperia T and it's successor the <a href="/qualcomm-krait-200-family-2nd-gen/sony-xperia-z/">Sony Xperia Z</a>. It is dual-core like the former, yet comes equipped with Adreno 320 graphics like the latter. The internal sensors are also a pick-and-mix from the two devices.

Despite the MSM8960T SoC only having two krait cores, they are clocked higher than those in the APQ8064 SoC found the Sony Xperia Z. Coupled with a lower resolution, it should actually out-perform the Sony Xperia Z in several benchmarks.

Support for this SoC at Code Aurora Forums is good, so we can Expect Sony to continue to look after this device for some time to come.
