Only a fortnight has passed since we announced support for <a href="/devices/fxp309-brings-cyanogenmod-11-support-to-sony-xperia-m/">Sony Xperia M</a>, yet the FreeXperia Project is happy to announce another supported device for March 2014, <a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z1-compact/">Sony Xperia Z1 Compact</a>!

Recently <a href="/press-release/sony-introduces-xperia-z1-compact-at-ces/">revealed at CES2014</a> in January, Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is an absolute marvel of a device. Sony Mobile took everything that makes the <a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z1/">Sony Xperia Z1</a> flagship device so great and put it in a compact package. Several reviews have even said it is one of the best Android devices available today due to its more manegable size.

It shares almost exactly the same internals as the Xperia Z1, joining it and the <a href="/qualcomm-krait-400-family/sony-xperia-z-ultra/">Sony Xperia Z Ultra</a> in the Qualcomm Krait 400 Family. It features Qualcomm MSM8974 SoC which means it has quad-core Krait 400 CPUs at 2.2GHz and Adreno 330 GPU. With that you also get 2GB Ram, 16GB storage, and the stunning 20.7MPx camera. It mostly differs by the smaller 4.3 inch 1280Ã—720 screen, and a slightly smaller battery.

Support will start at FXP311 with <a href="/cyanogenmod/cyanogenmod-11/">CyanogenMod 11</a>.

The codename for Xperia Z1 Compact is <strong>Amami</strong>, so make sure you download the correct ROM!
