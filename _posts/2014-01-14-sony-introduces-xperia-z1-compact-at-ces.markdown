These days <del>the Consumer Electronics Show</del> International CES has almost lost its importance in the mobile industry. This is partially because the US is a particularly hostile place for mobile phone manufacturers, but also because of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that takes place just a few weeks later.

As such, few surprises were expected at this year's CES, but Sony managed to get the most mobile attention with the introduction of the Xperia Z1 Compact.

Sony took all of the good elements of the Xperia Z1 and simply shrunk it to a more manageable size. I have long hated the insane mantra that 'bigger is better' as I feel it should be possible to use a phone in one hand.

The Xperia Z1 Compact Measures at 'only' 4.3" (Remember when we thought the Samsung Galaxy S II was huge?) but it keeps the quad-core Qualcomm MSM8974 processor, 20MPx camera, and the waterproof, aluminium frame. The resolution drops to 720p from 1080p, but it can still claim an impressive density of 341 ppi.

I hope this starts a trend of powerful, yet still reasonably sized phones. 'Mini' phones should retain the hardware of their larger brethren, not simply be cheap knock-offs of the real thing. I suppose that's why Sony chose 'Compact' instead of 'Mini', as other manufacturers have given that term bad connotations.
