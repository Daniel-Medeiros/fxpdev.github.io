During the final week of September, Manchester will be host to a gathering of mobile technology enthusiasts. Love it or hate it, <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/" target="_blank">XDA Developers</a> is undoubtedly the largest website for Android hobbyists and the first place to look for custom ROMs. With nearly 6 million registered users, the <a href="http://xda-devcon.com/" target="_blank">XDA:Devcon</a> will therefore have a significant reach into this community.

The second annual XDA:Devcon will be a two day conference that will cover a wide range of mobile technologies and projects, including Android (of course), Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, wearables and even robotics.

FXP will also be present! Alin Jerpelea gave a talk last year at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZNyWft4cvE&amp;list=PLgLZvFga2ml6HddpY2K-HkMUtlq7bnGFO" target="_blank">XDA:Devcon Miami</a>Â and this year he will give his first presentation since <a href="/uncategorized/alin-jerpelea-joins-sonys-developer-program/">joining the Sony Mobile team</a> in the summer.

Sony Mobile is often considered one of the most developer-friendly companies, so expect to hear about the history of developer relations at Sony Mobile, as well as plans for future cooperation.

If you've got a ticket, be sure to attend his talk on Saturday at 11am. There will also be talks by other Sony Mobile members, so plan your <a href="http://xda-devcon.com/schedule/" target="_blank">schedule</a> accordingly!

If you can't attend, be sure to check the video once it hits the XDA-Developers<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSexkM5a5pJ4idYdHAwVpMA" target="_blank"> YouTube channel</a>.
