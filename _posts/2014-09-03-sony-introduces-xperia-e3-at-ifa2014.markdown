Sony Mobile is devouring those Cortex-A7 chips. At IFA2014 Berin the Sony Xperia E3 was introduced shortly after the Xperia Z3 family. It is a budget device that is a step up from the <a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/sony-xperia-e1/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia E1</a> introduced at the beginning of 2014, but still inferior to the <a href="/qualcomm-cortex-a7-family/sony-xperia-m2/" title="" target="">Sony Xperia M2</a>.

This device brings the number in the Cortex-A7 family to 6. It has become a versatile device family, with screen sizes ranging from 4 inches to 6 inches, and a variety of screen and camera resolutions.

This particualar device features quad core MSM8926 at 1.2GHz and 1GB of RAM. It has a screen resolution of 845x480 (which seems quite low for a 4.5 inch device) and a 5MPx camera.

It's main distinguishing feature is that it has the same design as the Xperia Z3 family, with its rounded edges and refreshed colour range.
