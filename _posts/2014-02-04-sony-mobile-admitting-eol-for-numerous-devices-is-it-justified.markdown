The popular <a href="http://www.xperiablog.net/2014/02/04/sony-mobile-ends-software-support-for-xperia-s-ion-p-u-go-and-more/">Xperia Blog is reporting</a> that Sony Mobile is announcing the end of life for numerous Xperia devices. By adding 'latest and final version' to the software support pages of several phones, Sony Mobile is making it clear that there will be no upgrade to a newer version of Android, and possibly no more maintenance updates too.

However all the devices mentioned in the report are among those that have already been moved to legacy support from FreeXperia Project - we already knew this to be true. We knew because the <a href="http://www.stericsson.com/">ST-Ericsson partnership</a> collapsed, and Qualcomm made it clear via Code Aurora Forum that there would be no more support for older hardware.

This essentially means that Sony Mobile could not provide an update even if they wanted to.

Yet despite this 'news' making some people sad, Sony Mobile actually has a good track record of providing Android upgrades for their devices, where possible. They might not be the quickest, but nearly all the devices released under Sony Mobile have received updates to the latest version of Android the hardware supplier supports.

As proof, <strong>All</strong> Sony Mobile devices with <a href="/fuji-platform/">MSM8260 SoC</a> received upgrades to both Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and Android 4.1 Jellybean. In contrast, popular devices like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Sensation">HTC Sensation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Nitro_HD">LG Optimus LTE</a>, both missed out on a 4.1 upgrade. Many smaller manufacturers are usually even worse.

So while they would probably love to provide support for all devices forever (and so would we), Sony Mobile is definitely justified in saying these devices will not receive any more updates, it's mostly out of their control anyway.
