<h3>What is FXP?</h3>
FXP is a group of Android developers for Sony Mobile devices. Our main aim is to provide support for as many Sony Mobile devices as possible with the latest version of Android each device can handle.

<h3>Which alternative ROMs do we support?</h3>
Currently we provide ROMs based on Sony Mobile's AOSP repos, and CyanogenMod, which is based on Google's AOSP but with several functional modifications to support extra personalization. In the future we hope to provide a greater range of ROMs from other sources, not just CyanogenMod.

<h3>Which devices do we support?</h3>
Generally, we only support European Single SIM variants of devices. There are simply too many variants to support them all, and most of our developers only have the European Single SIM variants available to them anyway. However it should be fairly trivial to fork our work and modify it for other variants.

<h3>How can I install ROMs from FXP?</h3>
Follow the instructions on the tutorial pages. The main condition is that the option to unlock the bootloader is available on your device (this may be blocked by your mobile network provider if you obtained your device under subsidy) and you don't mind potentially voiding your warranty.

<h3>What is the difference between a CyanogenMod nightly and a release from FXP?</h3>
Probably nothing except for some FXP graphics at boot. CyanogenMod nightly builds are automated, untested and may be broken if the nighlty build bot synchronises the source code while new patches are being merged. During device bring-up we may test some patches in FXP before merging into CyanogenMod.

<h3>Is the source code available?</h3>
Absolutely! Android is an open source project, and so is ours. All our source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, often as part of CyanogenMod. For device specific repos, see the relevant device page.
